# This task involves three stages:
# 1. Robot 1 picks up the scalpel, and Robot 2 picks up the hemostat.
# 2. Robot 1 holds the scalpel 10 cm above the desk, and Robot 2 holds the hemostat 10 cm above the desk.
# 3. Robot 1 releases the scalpel on the desk, and Robot 2 releases the hemostat on the desk.
