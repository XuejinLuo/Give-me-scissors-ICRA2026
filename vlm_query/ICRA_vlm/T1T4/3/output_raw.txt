# The task involves the following stages:
# 1. Robot 1 grasps the scalpel at keypoint 2 while Robot 2 grasps the hemostat at keypoint 1.
# 2. Robot 1 lifts the scalpel to 10 cm above the desk while Robot 2 lifts the hemostat to 10 cm above the desk.
# 3. Robot 1 places the scalpel back on the desk and releases it, and Robot 2 places the hemostat back on the desk and releases it.
