# The task involves 4 stages:
# Stage 1: Robot 1 grasps the scalpel while Robot 2 grasps the scissors.
# Stage 2: Robot 1 lifts the scalpel 10 cm above the desk while Robot 2 lifts the scissors 10 cm above the desk.
# Stage 3: Robot 1 places the scalpel back on the desk and releases it.
# Stage 4: Robot 2 places the scissors back on the desk and releases it.
