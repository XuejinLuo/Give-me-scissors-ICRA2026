# The task consists of three stages: 
# Stage 1: Robot 1 grasps the scalpel at keypoint 1 while Robot 2 grasps the scissors at keypoint 2.
# Stage 2: Robot 1 holds the scalpel above 10 cm from the desk while Robot 2 does the same with the scissors.
# Stage 3: Robot 1 releases the scalpel on the desk, and Robot 2 releases the scissors on the desk.
